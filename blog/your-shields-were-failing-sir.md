You enjoyed that. I will obey your orders. I will serve this ship as First Officer. And in an attack against the Enterprise, I will die with this crew. But I will not break my oath of loyalty to Starfleet. You bet I'm agitated! I may be surrounded by insanity, but I am not insane. Ensign Babyface! The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. A surprise party? Mr. Worf, I hate surprise parties. I would \*never\* do that to you. Could someone survive inside a transporter buffer for 75 years? I am your worst nightmare!
